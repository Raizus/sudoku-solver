The numbers in the cage must sum to the given total in the top left (if one exists).\n\n**Thermometer:** Numbers along a thermometer must increase from the bulb end.\n\n**Palindrome:** Gray lines are palindromes, reading the same when reversed. eg 12321 or 4554.\n\n**Arrow:** The digits along an arrow must sum to the number in the connecting pill (read left-to right or downwards) or circle. Digits may repeat on a arrow if allowed by other rules.\n\n**Odd:** Cells with grey circles must contain odd numbers.\n\n**Difference:** Numbers separated by a white circle are consecutive. Cells separated by a white circle with a number X must have a difference of X.\n\n**Ratio:** Cells separated by a black dot have a 1:2 ratio or a 1:X ratio if the circle has value X.\n\n**XV:** Two cells joined by X must sum to 10. Two cells joined by a V must sum to 5.\n\n**Quadruple:** Numbers in a circle must appear at least once in the four cells touched by the circle.\n\n**X-Sum:** A clue outside the grid gives the sum of the first X digits from that direction, where X is the first of those digits.\n\n**Little Killer Sum:** A clue with an arrow outside the grid shows the sum of the numbers along the indicated diagonal.",
