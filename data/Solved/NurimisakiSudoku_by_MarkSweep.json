No 2x2 region may be entirely shaded or unshaded. Circles mark every instance of a cell which is unshaded and orthogonally adjacent to exactly one other unshaded cell (i.e. the circles are the only 'endpoints' of the unshaded area). The digit in a circle indicates how many cells are in the straight line of unshaded cells coming out of the cell with the circle, including itself.\n\n**All Nurimisaki Unshaded Endpoints Are Given:** Circles mark every instance of a cell which is unshaded and orthogonally adjacent to exactly one other unshaded cell (i.e. the circles are the only 'endpoints' of the unshaded area).\n\n**Cells Along Nurimisaki Path Have A Difference Of At Least 5.**\n\n**Nurimisaki Unshaded Endpoints:** Circles mark an instance of a cell which is unshaded and orthogonally adjacent to exactly one other unshaded cell (i.e. the circles mark 'endpoints' of the unshaded area).
