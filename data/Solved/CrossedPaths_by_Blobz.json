A similar path crosses the grid from top to bottom, starting with a 1 in row 1, then a 2 in row 2, ending with a 9 in row 9. Again, cells along the path are connected orthogonally or diagonally. The paths (which do not share cells, nor appear in any cage) are to be determined by the solver.\n\n**Killer Cage:** Numbers must not repeat in a killer cage. The numbers in the cage must sum to the given total in the top left (if one exists).",
